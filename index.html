Lieve Oma is a top-down 3D game where you go for a stroll with your grandmother through a forest. You can pick mushrooms when you find them, but the real reason you're here is to have a discussion with your grandmother about the issues you encounter, coping with going to a new school, among other things.<br>The game was released on April 5th, my grandmother's birthday!<br><a href="https://vltmn.itch.io/lieve-oma">You can get it right here</a>.

                    <h1>the Endless Express</h1>It's a game based on a
                    prototype I made with some friends for the <i>7dfps
                    challenge</i> in 2014, we decided that the world and the
                    ideas we had for the project deserved to be expanded
                    upon.<br>
                    The scope of the project was quite large. I've done all the
                    programming on the game, and was also doing everything
                    related to the engine—making the shaders, building the
                    levels, wiring the dialogue,…<br>
                    I do consider my main activity in the project to be the
                    game and level designer though, as that's the part I was
                    most interested in.<br>
                    The game is <i>very</i> content-heavy, most of the assets
                    were one-off elements that don't appear anywhere else in
                    the game, so that was quite a bit of work. I feel like the
                    game is, on the development-side, very close to a
                    point-and-click adventure game in structure.

People have told us that the game punishes the player for exploring, which was not the wanted reaction.<br>We plan on releasing the game during spring 2016, giving us time to add new content and adjust the game based on the feedback we've had.</span>

                    <h1>Life is Short</h1>a short interactive experience for a
                    project by the NFB and ARTE, called <i>interactive
                    haikus</i>. You can play the game <a href=
                    "http://interactivehaiku.com/lifeisshort/" target=
                    "_blank">over here</a>, the game takes about a minute or
                    two to complete.<br>
                    Without spoiling the game and purely from a design
                    perspective, I wanted to toy with what the player's learned
                    by playing the game.<br>
                    During the whole game you learn to do certain things, but
                    at certain points I decided to subvert the player's
                    expectations by changing the rules.<br>
                    This very systemic change is, in my eyes, the way
                    interactive media can tell a story. So I used this sort of
                    mechanics switch to communicate a narrative switch, to have
                    it have a greater impact.

The game's pace as well as the audience of the TV networks incited me to change this, and tutorialize each micro-game. In the end this turned out to be an opportunity to give the player some breathing time.</span>

                    <h1>Catalepsie</h1>I wrote my graduate thesis on the topic
                    of written storytelling in a multimedia context; that's why
                    my graduate project was also about how to present narrative text on
                    screens, without necessarily relying on the concept of pages.
                    Instead, the text was linked to geographic points in the
                    experience's world.<br>
                    The main challenge in making the experience, was to make it
                    as accessible as possible to people not used to digital
                    devices. This was mainly due to the audience I had, which
                    was comprised of book editors, illustrators and the
                    likes.<br>
                    The game was meant for tablets.<br>
                    You hold the device up as if you were taking a picture, to
                    look around, and press the screen to move along a set path.
                    This appeared to be the most intuitive approach to have the
                    non-initiated audience, to move and interact with the first
                    person experience.

                    also learned that if you haven't yet built a proper
                    narrative and haven't pulled the player in too much yet,
                    it's not much of an issue to actually break the fourth wall

                                The story focuses on the experience of a patient that has been hypnotized to cure her recurring phantom pain. The project being a vessel for the ideas I proposed in my graduate thesis, I chose the topic of hypnosis as a metaphor of a narrative experience having a lasting impact on the subject.<br><br>The project was presented at the graduate exhibition of the <i>École Supérieure des Arts Décoratifs</i> in Strasbourg.

                    <h1>Safari</h1>Besides my degree work, I also made a few
                    small projects with some illustrator friends from my class,
                    when I was studying illustration.<br>
                    I made this project called <i>Safari</i> with Alice
                    Meteignier, which is about discovering and wandering
                    through a strange internal world wrapped onto itself.<br>
                    We wanted to basically concentrate on the act of wandering,
                    which is something you don't really do in most forms of
                    expression. So it was an exploration of all the weird
                    things that are possible when having even a tiny bit of
                    agency.<br>
                    Besides that, the game was also an exercise in style,
                    exploring new forms of image creation and working with
                    someone who isn't used to producing game-ready things.

                    I made <i>Faux-Pas</i> with Maïté Grandjouan, which is
                    about a premonition of a very mundane accident.<br>
                    You can walk around and open these various doors, taking
                    you to weird places that all kind of relate to the event at
                    the end of the experience… There's a room with a bunch of
                    fish on the floor and curtains as walls, which are elements
                    seen at the end of the game; in another room there's this
                    carpet that's liquid like water, which (p)recalls the
                    accident, etcetera.<br>
                    It's mainly an excercice in both style, narrative, and
                    working with someone who's not used to a games-related
                    pipeline.

                    <h1>a christmas greeting card</h1>The first time I
                    experimented with <i>three.js</i> was when I was studying
                    illustration at the art school I went to, and a lot of
                    people were making sort of season's greeting cards and
                    images.<br>
                    I decided it'd be interesting for me to make my own
                    season's greetings card, so I thought of making <a href=
                    "http://stuff.recto-ver.so/xmas2013.html" target=
                    "_blank">this sort of diorama thing</a>.<br>
                    Since I was an illustration student, I was thinking a lot
                    about sequential art like comics and the likes, so that
                    probably influenced my choice of telling the complete story
                    in one picture, while still having the various stages of a
                    story being told—basically like a page out of a comic book.

                    <h1>The Dead Rest Beneath Us</h1>Here's a game I made for
                    the Ludum Dare game jam #29, where the topic was "beneath
                    the surface". While brainstorming on this topic, I thought
                    of when you're buried, you're basically beneath the
                    surface. This got the ball rolling for me to think about
                    death in games.<br>
                    Usually death in games is just a minor penalty, you either
                    get multiple lives anyway, or you just get set back a bit.
                    Death is truly made to be a minor obstacle. Another thing
                    that is related to this, is the fact that obstacles games
                    must always be surmountable. You must always be able to
                    overcome death and win the game.<br>
                    So I decided to just run with this, even though I was a bit
                    off-topic for the game jam.
