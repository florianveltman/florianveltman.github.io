	It's the season for penny buns, Grandma forced you to come along a bit. But deep down you know it'll do you good and take your mind off of things.
	My grandmother is probably the most important person ever to me, as she provided me with the stability and care a child needs growing up. We all have or have had people helping us become a responsible and caring person, and this short narrative game is an ode to these people.

	<history>
	A few onths ago, my grandmother had a small household accident, with big consequences. One of those consequences was that I realised that she might not be around forever, and that I need to cherish her presence, so I decided to make this game as an ode to her sweetness and her giving me the space to be myself.
