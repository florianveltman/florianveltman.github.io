	It's the season for penny buns, Grandma forced you to come along a bit. But deep down you know it'll do you good and take your mind off of things. Lieve Oma is a top-down 3D game where you go for a stroll with your grandmother through a forest. You can pick mushrooms when you find them, but the real reason you're here is to have a discussion with your grandmother about the issues you encounter, coping with going to a new school, among other things. The game will be released on itch.io on April 5th, my grandmother's birthday!

	<history>
	    My grandmother is probably the most important person ever to me, as she provided me with the stability and care a child needs growing up. We all have or have had people helping us become a responsible and caring person, and this short narrative game is an ode to these people. A few months ago, my grandmother had a small household accident, with big consequences. One of those consequences was that I realised that she might not be around forever, and that I need to cherish her presence, so I decided to make this game as an ode to her sweetness and her giving me the space to be myself.
